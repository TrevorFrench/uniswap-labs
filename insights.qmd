Daily active users are still mostly web users.

```{python}
sns.lineplot(data=dau, palette="tab10", linewidth=2.5)
```

However, the mobile platform is seeing exponential growth.

```{python}
sns.lineplot(data=dau[['day', 'mobile']], palette="tab10", linewidth=2.5)
```

The mobile platform is notably more "sticky" though this metric could be skewed due to most of the DAUs being seen in the second half of the month. This is a metric to keep an eye on in the coming months.

```{python}
sns.lineplot(data=stickiness, palette="tab10", linewidth=2.5)
```
